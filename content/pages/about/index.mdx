# I AM COLIN GERRITSEN
and I wear two hats: one as a designer and the other as an improv actor.
 These seemingly distinct worlds converge to define my unique perspective.

Design, to me, is the perfect blend of adaptability and creativity. It's about crafting solutions that seamlessly mold themselves to the ever-changing needs of our world. Making things that just click into place, like they always belonged there.

Improv, on the other hand, is my playground for exploring creativity without boundaries. The stage becomes a canvas where spontaneity is natural. In this world of unpredictability, I've learned to embrace creativity in its rawest form. It forces me to think outside the confines of any preconceived box, encouraging new ideas, and igniting unexpected sparks of genius.

Empathy serves as the unifying thread in both my design and improv journeys.

On the stage, it's about anticipating and reciprocating the actions of my fellow actors. It's stepping into the shoes of the characters I portray, understanding their essence, and doing them justice by bringing their stories to life.

In design, empathy is the bridge to understanding the user. It's about immersing myself in their world, feeling their needs, and discerning their desires. It's through this empathetic connection that I can craft experiences tailored to fit their unique perspectives.
So, in my world, design and improv seamlessly blendâ€”a harmonious duet of adaptability, creativity, and empathy. They are the lenses through which I view the world, and they inspire me to craft solutions that makes people feel
