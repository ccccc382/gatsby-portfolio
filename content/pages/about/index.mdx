# I AM COLIN GERRITSEN
I see the world through two lenses: one as a designer and the other as an improv actor. 
These seemingly distinct worlds converge to define my unique perspective.
Design, to me, is the perfect blend of adaptability and creativity. It's about crafting solutions that seamlessly mold themselves to the ever-changing needs of our world. Making things that just click into place, like they always belonged there.

Improv is my playground for exploring without boundaries. The stage is my canvas to experiment with everything that gets thrown at me. Improv is a world of unpredictability. It forces me to think outside the box. I have not only learned to work with the unknown, but also to embrace it. 

The common denominator between design and improv is empathy. 

In design, it is the bridge to understanding the user. It's about immersing myself in their world, feeling their needs, and discerning their desires.

On the stage, it's about anticipating and reciprocating the actions of my fellow actors. It's stepping into the shoes of the characters I portray, understanding their essence, and doing them justice by bringing their stories to life.

Design and improv are the lenses through which I view the world, and by lining them up together. I can combine the knowledge from both fields to find inventive solutions to the most challenging problems.
