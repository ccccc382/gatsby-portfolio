> ## “De salamander
> ## een tent zoals geen ander”

The Salamander is a tent inspired by its animal namesake. Salamander means lizard in Dutch. Like lizards, the Salamander is able to regenerate and replace lost limbs.

Unlike traditional tents, which are made from a single piece of canvas, the Salamander is made from several easily replaceable pieces. This allows the tent to be repaired on site at a festival or event. This reduces critical downtime. 

Additional focus has been placed on improving the user experience for the organisation using the tent. The introduction of a new tensioning system in combination with locking points that use a quick-release system has reduced setup time to 4 minutes for a 2-man team. When stored, the tent fits into a stackable format for efficient storage. 

All this has been achieved without compromising the experience of luxury and quality expected from a De Waard tent. 

I focused on working on the various working mechanisms of the tent and its design. I worked on the quick release and the tensioning system. The subsequent 3D visualisations of the tent were created using keyshot.
