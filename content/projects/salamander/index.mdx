> “De salamander
>  een tent zoals geen ander”

The Salamander (dutch for lizard) is a tent inspired by its namesake. Like lizards that are able to replace losts limbs. The dsign of this tent allows for user friendly and onsite replacements of parts. This allows the organization renting out these tents to reduce downtime related to repairs.

Focus was put on decreasing setup time per tent. But making clever use of a new tensioning system system combined with quick releases and stackable storage. Allow the tents to be setup in les than 4 minutes. All the while keeping the luxury materials and construction. Expected from a the waard tent. 
My focus during this project was working on the quick release and tensioning systems aswell as the design and subsequent 3d visualizations of the tent.
