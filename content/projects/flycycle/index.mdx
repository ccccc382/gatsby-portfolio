. #### “Imagine riding on your bike, and slowly lifting of the pavement and into the air.
Now get ready to experience it!”

The flycle is a heavily modified exercise bike fitted with multiple sensors to translate all user controls to digital inputs. These inputs are connected to flight simulator that is show to the user trough a virtual reality headset. 

Initially, the user embarks on a journey pedaling across an expansive open field, surrounded by the beauty of the virtual landscape. However, the true magic of the Flycle unfolds when the user instinctively grasps the handlebars and pulls them towards themselves. In that electrifying moment, the bike responds by gracefully taking flight, just as in the iconic scene from the movie E.T.
