This project was used as a learning exercise. My aim was to practise photorealistic rendering and sketching. I started the project with a sketch of a simple torch. I then made a presentation sketch to practise my design sketching. This design sketch was then translated into a 3D model, which I then 3D printed to scale. This 3D printed model was used to get a feel for the play of shadow and light on the object. It provided a realistic reference when converting the model into a photorealistic render.
