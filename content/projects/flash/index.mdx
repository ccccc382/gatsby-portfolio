This project was an learning exercice my goal was to practice with photorealistic rendering and sketching i started of making a sketch of a simple flash light design. 
The design was translated to a 3d model which was 3d printed. The 3d printed model was used to ge a better idea of thea shading of the flashlight.
This information was then used for the creation of a photorealistic render
