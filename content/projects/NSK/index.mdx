NSK Theatersports, short for "Nederlandstalig studenten kampioenschap Theatersports," stands as the premier Dutch-spoken student theatre improv event in the Netherlands and Belgium. It is a grand spectacle where creativity and spontaneity converge. In the year 2022, I had the honor of assuming the role of Creative Director for the 30th edition, tasked with shaping the event's identity.
The central theme I envisioned for this edition revolved around the actors revealing a side of themselves that remains hidden off-stage. It was an representation of the personas they embody exclusively within the realm of theater.
To encapsulate this concept visually, I ventured beyond the conventional. Instead of typical board representative photographs, I chose to showcase their "other sides." This visual narrative was achieved through striking contrasts and the bold white slash that cleaved through the design. The distressed and weathered aesthetic echoed the raw, unfiltered emotions portrayed by the events actors.

The logo crafted for the NSK Tournament 2022 symbolized this core theme: "Two sides." It incorporated a mask motif, a powerful emblem of transformation and duality.
For the event's promotion and announcement, I devised a two-phase poster strategy. The first round served as a teaser, intentionally vague, stoking curiosity among viewers. The second round was designed to provide detailed information about the event, its schedule, and relevant particulars. What made this approach unique was the continuity of visual elements from the teaser poster to the informative one. As a way to lure the audience into discovering the answer to their initial curiosity.

Creating and giving form to the NSK proved to be a project where i could truely use all of my skills. Due to some budgetary constraints I had to get creative and cut expenses where possible, while still striving for a professional result. By lasercutting and 3d printing a 3d models stencil painting tool, to rapidly stencil the logo onto the entry wristbands.
During the event information was provided to the audience and contestants with booklets, as well as a large live updated scoreboard that I programmed using react.js that allowed for score keeping logistics to be simplified
